To run the Prototype, run "main.py".
I recommend clearing the list of players using the SetUp section at the beginning of the program. To do this, when you see the inscription "Want to setup Game?" write "edit", then "clear" and press Enter twice. Now you can add your own players` names. If you have any difficulties with this, write "help"
